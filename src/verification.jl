    run_checksum(checksum, path)

THis runs the checksum on the files at the fetched_path.
And returns true or false base on if the checksum matchs.
(always true if no target sum given)
It is kinda flexible and accepts different kinds of behavour
to give different kinds of results.

If path (the second parameter) is a Vector,
then unless checksum is also a Vector,
the result is the xor of the all the file checksums.
